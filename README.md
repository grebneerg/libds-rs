# libds

An implementation of the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) driver station communication protocol in Rust.

## What can it do?
It can enable robots and set some information, but anything using TCP (including joysticks and gamedata) does not work. Contributions are welcome, but if you are looking for something usable then the [ds-rs](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/ds-rs) project is a better choice.
